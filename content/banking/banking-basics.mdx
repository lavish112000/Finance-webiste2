## Introduction to Banking

Banks are the backbone of the financial system. They provide a safe place to store your money, facilitate transactions, and offer loans to help you achieve your financial goals. Understanding the basics of banking is the first step towards financial literacy.

## Types of Bank Accounts

### 1. Savings Account
The most common type of account. It offers a modest interest rate and provides easy access to your funds via debit cards, ATMs, and online banking.
- **Best for:** Emergency funds, short-term savings.
- **Interest Rate:** Typically 2.70% - 4.00% p.a.

### 2. Current Account
Designed for businesses and individuals with high transaction volumes. It usually offers no interest but comes with higher withdrawal limits and overdraft facilities.
- **Best for:** Business owners, frequent traders.
- **Interest Rate:** 0%

### 3. Fixed Deposit (FD)
A term deposit where you lock your money for a fixed period in exchange for a higher interest rate.
- **Best for:** Risk-free returns, tax saving (5-year lock-in).
- **Interest Rate:** 6.00% - 7.50% p.a.

### 4. Recurring Deposit (RD)
Similar to an FD, but allows you to deposit a fixed amount every month.

## How to Choose the Right Bank

When selecting a bank, consider the following factors:

1.  **Interest Rates:** Compare savings and FD rates.
