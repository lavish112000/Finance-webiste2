Your credit score is one of the most important numbers in your financial life. It determines whether you'll get approved for loans, the interest rates you'll pay, and even affects job applications and rental agreements. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and master your credit score in India.

## What is a Credit Score?

A **credit score** is a three-digit number (300-900) that represents your creditworthiness - how likely you are to repay borrowed money. It's calculated based on your credit history and borrowing behavior.

### Credit Bureaus in India

| Bureau | Full Name | Market Share |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| CIBIL | TransUnion CIBIL | ~80% (most widely used) |
| Equifax | Equifax India | ~10% |
| Experian | Experian India | ~5% |
| CRIF High Mark | CRIF High Mark | ~5% |

All bureaus collect credit data from banks and financial institutions and calculate scores using similar but slightly different algorithms.

## Understanding Your CIBIL Score

### Score Ranges

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 750-900 | Excellent | Easily get loans at best rates |
| 700-749 | Good | High approval chances, good rates |
| 650-699 | Fair | Approval possible, higher rates |
| 550-649 | Poor | Difficult to get loans |
| 300-549 | Very Poor | Very unlikely to get credit |
| -1 | No History | No credit information available |

**Target: Always aim for 750+** for best loan terms and easy approvals.

### What Lenders See

When you apply for a loan or credit card, lenders check:
- Your credit score
- Detailed credit report
- Payment history
- Current debts
- Credit utilization
- Recent credit inquiries

## Components of Credit Score

### CIBIL Score Factors

| Factor | Weightage | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Payment History | 30% | On-time payment track record |
| Credit Utilization | 25% | How much credit you're using |
| Credit History Length | 25% | Age of accounts |
| Credit Mix | 10% | Variety of credit types |
| Recent Credit | 10% | New applications & accounts |

### 1. Payment History (30%)

**Most Important Factor**

- Every on-time payment: +points
- Every late payment: -points
- Default/write-off: Major damage

**Impact of Late Payments:**

| Delay | Impact on Score |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1-30 days | Minimal (may not be reported) |
| 30-60 days | Moderate (-30 to -50 points) |
| 60-90 days | Significant (-50 to -80 points) |
| 90+ days | Severe (-80 to -150 points) |
| Default/Settlement | Very severe (can drop 200+ points) |

### 2. Credit Utilization (25%)

**Credit Utilization Ratio** = (Total Used Credit / Total Available Credit) × 100

**Example:**
- Credit card limit: ₹2,00,000
- Balance used: ₹60,000
- Utilization: 30%

**Ideal Utilization:**

| Ratio | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Under 10% | Excellent |
| 10-30% | Good |
| 30-50% | Fair |
| 50-70% | Poor |
| Over 70% | Very Poor |

**Tip**: Keep utilization below 30%, ideally below 10%.

### 3. Credit History Length (25%)

- Older accounts = better score
- Average age of accounts matters
- Never close your oldest credit card

**Impact:**

| History Length | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Less than 1 year | Limited credit history |
| 1-3 years | Building credit |
| 3-7 years | Established credit |
| 7+ years | Strong credit history |

### 4. Credit Mix (10%)

Having a healthy mix of credit types:
- **Secured**: Home loan, car loan, gold loan
- **Unsecured**: Credit cards, personal loans
- **Revolving**: Credit cards
- **Installment**: EMI-based loans

**Ideal Mix**: 2-3 different types (e.g., 1 credit card + 1 home loan)

### 5. Recent Credit (10%)

Multiple loan applications in short time = red flag

**Hard Inquiry Impact:**
- Each application: -5 to -10 points
- Multiple inquiries: Looks desperate
- Effect lasts: 6-12 months

**Tip**: Space out loan applications by at least 3-6 months.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does negative information stay on my credit report?
Most negative information stays for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. This includes late payments, defaults, and settlements. Bankruptcies can stay up to 10 years. Inquiries stay for 2 years but impact only for 6-12 months.

### Can I get a loan with a credit score of 650?
Yes, but with limitations. You may get approved for certain loans but at higher interest rates, lower amounts, or with stricter terms. For best chances, aim to improve to 700+ before applying for major loans.

### Do salary and income affect my credit score?
No, your income is not directly factored into your credit score calculation. However, lenders do consider income separately when evaluating loan applications. Your score is based solely on credit behavior.

### Will closing unused credit cards improve my score?
No, closing credit cards usually hurts your score by reducing available credit (increasing utilization) and potentially lowering average account age. Keep old cards active with small purchases instead.

### How often does my credit score update?
Your credit score typically updates once a month when lenders report new information to bureaus. The exact timing varies by lender, so you may see changes throughout the month as different accounts report.

### Can I have different scores from different bureaus?
Yes, scores can vary slightly across bureaus because not all lenders report to all bureaus, and each bureau may use slightly different scoring models. Differences of 20-50 points are normal.

### Does checking my own credit score hurt it?
No, checking your own score is a "soft inquiry" and does not affect your score. Only "hard inquiries" from loan or credit card applications can temporarily lower your score by a few points.

### Can I remove accurate negative information from my report?
No, you cannot remove accurate negative information before it naturally falls off (usually 7 years). You can only dispute and remove incorrect information. Focus on building positive credit instead.
