## What are Neobanks?

Neobanks are digital-only banks that operate without any physical branches. They leverage technology to offer a seamless, user-friendly banking experience, often at lower costs than traditional banks. Examples include Jupiter, Fi, and Niyo.

| **User Experience** | Can be clunky | Modern, intuitive apps |
| **Fees** | Higher (maintenance, SMS, etc.) | Lower or Zero fees |
| **Customer Support** | In-person, Phone | Chat, Email, AI Bots |

## Which One Should You Choose?

### Choose a Traditional Bank if:
