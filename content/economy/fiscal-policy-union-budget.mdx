# Fiscal Policy & Union Budget

While monetary policy is managed by the central bank, **fiscal policy** is the domain of the government. It involves the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.

## Components of Fiscal Policy

### 1. Government Spending
The government spends money on infrastructure, defense, education, healthcare, and social welfare schemes. This spending stimulates economic activity.

### 2. Taxation
Taxes are the primary source of revenue for the government. By adjusting tax rates (income tax, GST, corporate tax), the government can influence consumption and investment.

### 3. Deficit & Debt
When the government spends more than it earns, it runs a **fiscal deficit**. This is financed by borrowing, which adds to the national debt.

## The Union Budget

In India, the Union Budget is the annual financial statement of the government. It outlines estimated receipts and expenditure for the upcoming financial year.

### Key Terms to Know

*   **Fiscal Deficit:** The difference between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowings).
*   **Revenue Deficit:** The excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
*   **Capital Expenditure (Capex):** Spending on creating assets like roads, bridges, and factories. Capex has a high multiplier effect on the economy.
