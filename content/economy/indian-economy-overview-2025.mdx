## GDP Growth Trajectory

India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the post-pandemic era. The economy has maintained a growth rate of 6-7%, consistently outpacing most major economies globally.

### Sector-wise Performance

**Services Sector (55% of GDP)**
The services sector remains the backbone of India's economy:
- IT and business services continue to attract global clients
- Financial services expanding with digital adoption
- Healthcare sector growing post-pandemic
- Tourism and hospitality recovering strongly

**Manufacturing Sector (28% of GDP)**
Manufacturing is receiving a significant push:
- Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 sectors
- Electronics manufacturing growing rapidly
- Automotive sector transitioning to EVs
- Pharmaceutical exports maintaining strength

**Agriculture Sector (17% of GDP)**
Despite lower GDP contribution, agriculture remains crucial:
- Employs over 40% of the workforce
- Record foodgrain production
- Agricultural exports reaching new highs
- Technology adoption improving productivity

### Key Growth Drivers

1. **Domestic Consumption**: India's growing middle class, estimated at 400+ million people, is driving consumption across categories from FMCG to automobiles to consumer electronics.

2. **Digital Transformation**: UPI transactions exceeding 10 billion monthly, digital lending expanding, and e-commerce penetration increasing.

3. **Infrastructure Development**: PM Gati Shakti initiative integrating multi-modal connectivity with over ₹100 lakh crore investment planned.

4. **Government Reforms**: GST stabilization, improved ease of doing business rankings, and simplified compliance procedures.

5. **FDI Inflows**: India attracting $70-80 billion annually in foreign direct investment.

## Inflation & Price Stability

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been largely successful in anchoring inflation expectations within its mandated target band of 2-6%.

### Inflation Trends

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has moderated from the highs of 7%+ seen in 2022 to more manageable levels of 4-5%. Key factors:

- **Food Inflation**: Volatile due to weather conditions, but government interventions helping stabilize prices
- **Core Inflation**: Moderating as supply chain pressures ease
- **Fuel Prices**: Impact of global crude oil prices, though somewhat cushioned by excise duty cuts

### RBI's Monetary Policy Stance

The RBI has maintained a "withdrawal of accommodation" stance while remaining growth-supportive:

> "Price stability is essential for sustainable economic growth. The RBI remains committed to anchoring inflation expectations while supporting growth."
> — RBI Monetary Policy Statement

## Employment & Labor Markets

Employment generation remains one of India's most critical challenges and opportunities:

### Current Scenario

- **Urban Unemployment**: Declined to around 6-7% but remains elevated for educated youth
- **Gig Economy**: Growing rapidly, providing flexible employment to millions
- **Informal Sector**: Still employs majority of workforce, posing challenges for social security
- **Female Labor Participation**: At 25-30%, significantly below global averages

### Government Initiatives for Employment

|--------|---------------------|------------|
| PM Mudra Yojana | Micro-entrepreneurs | Self-employment |
| Skill India | Youth | Skill development |
| PM Rojgar Protsahan | Employers | Formal employment |

2. **Skill Gaps**: Mismatch between industry requirements and workforce skills
3. **Infrastructure Deficits**: Despite improvements, gaps remain in rural areas
