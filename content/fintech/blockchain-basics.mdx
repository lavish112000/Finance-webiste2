## What is Blockchain?

At its core, a **blockchain** is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the network.
2.  **Immutability:** Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed.
3.  **Transparency:** All participants can view the ledger (in public blockchains).

## How Does it Work?

1.  **Transaction:** Someone requests a transaction.
2.  **Block:** The transaction is broadcast to a P2P network consisting of computers (nodes).
3.  **Verification:** The network of nodes validates the transaction and the user's status using known algorithms.
4.  **Hash:** Once verified, the transaction is combined with other transactions to create a new block of data for the ledger.
5.  **Chain:** The new block is then added to the existing blockchain, in a way that is permanent and unalterable.

## Use Cases Beyond Crypto

While Bitcoin made blockchain famous, the technology has applications far beyond digital currency:

### 1. Supply Chain Management
Blockchain can track the movement of goods from origin to consumer, ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud.

### 2. Healthcare
Securely storing patient records that can be shared with authorized providers while maintaining privacy.

### 3. Voting Systems
Creating tamper-proof voting systems where votes can be verified by anyone but the voter's identity remains anonymous.

### 4. Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.

## The Future of Blockchain

As the technology matures, we can expect to see more enterprise adoption. Issues like scalability and energy consumption are being addressed by newer consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Stake), paving the way for a decentralized future.
