## Understanding Recessions

A **recession** is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth (GDP). However, economists look at a broader range of indicators to identify a downturn.

## Key Indicators

### 1. Inverted Yield Curve
Historically, when short-term interest rates (like the 2-year Treasury yield) are higher than long-term rates (10-year yield), it has been a reliable predictor of a recession.

### 2. Manufacturing Activity (PMI)
The **Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)** measures the direction of economic trends in manufacturing. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.

### 3. Consumer Confidence
When people feel insecure about their jobs or the economy, they spend less. A sharp drop in consumer confidence often precedes a slowdown.

### 4. Unemployment Rate
While often a lagging indicator, a rapid rise in unemployment is a clear sign of economic distress.

## Global Impact

In a connected world, a recession in major economies like the US or China can trigger a global slowdown.

### Safe Haven Assets
During uncertain times, investors often flock to "safe haven" assets:
- **Gold:** Historically maintains value.
- **US Dollar:** The world's reserve currency.
- **Government Bonds:** Considered low-risk.

## Conclusion

While no single indicator is perfect, monitoring these signals can help investors and businesses prepare for potential economic headwinds.
